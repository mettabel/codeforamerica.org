                        <p>The Code for America team in the City of Charlotte is working to increase citizen engagement by providing citizens with access to relevant and accurate information. By helping citizens better understand what’s going on in their area, when it’s going to happen, and why, cities can build trust through transparency and proactively incorporate constituent feedback.</p>

                        Enter Citygram, a geographically-relevant notifications platform powered by open data. It delivers notifications to citizens via SMS and e-mail based on their self-designated geographic areas and topics of interest (e.g. traffic, public meetings, rezoning, etc.). Citygram aims to serve two goals:
                         <ol>
                          <li>to share relevant information that people want  in a simple, elegant way.</li>
                          <li>2. to make raw data not only open, but also meaningful to people.</li>
